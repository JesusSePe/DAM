It is discussed in chapter 11.

This project implements a simple sound player, mainly for experimenting with
GUI building.

To use this project, create a SoundPlayerGUI object.

This player can play WAV, AIFF, and AU files with standard 22.050 kHz 
or 11.025 kHz sample rates. (This means that not all files stored in these
formats can be played -- the actual encoding matters.)
